# House-price-prediction

For a number of parties involved, including buyers, sellers, real estate brokers, and financial institutions, predicting home values is essential. Making educated decisions about loans, market analysis, and real estate investments can be aided by accurate forecasts. Our goal in this project is to apply a machine learning algorithm to develop a predictive model that will estimate property prices based on several house attributes.

Dataset:
We utilize the well-known California Housing dataset for this study, which includes details on a range of Boston properties. Features including the number of rooms, age of the house, distance to work centers, and the goal variable—the median value of owner-occupied homes—are all included in each entry in the dataset.
